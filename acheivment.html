    <h2>FOSS United: Our Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
        Our team is committed to building a future where technology is accessible, open, and inclusive. 
        We are inspired by the journey of the <strong>FOSS United Foundation</strong>, which has been a catalyst 
        for open-source innovation in India since 2020.
    </p>

    <h3>The Story So Far</h3>
    <p>
        FOSS United was founded through a collaboration between <strong>Frappe</strong> and <strong>Zerodha</strong>. 
        It has grown from a one-person initiative by <strong>Vishal Arya</strong> to a strong community of developers and volunteers.
